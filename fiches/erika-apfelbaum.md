De nationalité allemande, E.Apfelbaum arrive en France en 1937. Elle fait des études de psychologie sociale puis, en 1968, elle expose sa thèse sur les conflits avant de devenir chercheuse au CNRS. En 1991, elle devient membre du GEDISST (Groupe d'Études sur la Division Sociale et Sexuelle du Travail).  
Elle décrit son envie de participer à l'aventure du [[20230810230141]] laboratoire de psychologie sociale @apfelbaumTideMakingWaves2009 :
>A “laboratory” was attached to the chair, and to run it, D. Lagache gathered around him people with very diverse intellectual and even cultural backgrounds, transfuges from philosophy, science and/or politics. Jean Maisonneuve, Paul Durandin, Robert Pagès or Serge Moscovici who have been my teachers were the principal protagonists of this first group. This early generation of social psychologists was a generation without forefathers; their training was not in psychology, let alone in social psychology. This created a climate of euristic freedom, their diversity enriched the enterprise, giving it a stirring atmosphere of intellectual
revolution. Each member of the group pushed towards new unexplored spaces and little by little staked their claims to a number of social psychological issues and topics.. The boundaries between what was in and what was out of social psychology was not yet clearly defined, nor were there well defined research traditions. The pioneer mentality which prevailed was exhilarating and spilled over to my generation. We were willing to participate in the adventure, despite the lack of safety for the future.

Elle décrit dans le même article l'enthousiasme de [[20230808194045]] Robert Pagès durant son séjour dans le Michigan :
>For social psychology as well, in the 1950's a trip to the US was almost an initiation ritual. I remember the excitement in Robert Pagès’s voice when he reported to us his experiences of the T groups in which he had participated in Michigan. By then, he had become the head of Lagache’s laboratory, but despite his interest
in group dynamics, he gave a firm experimental orientation to his research group, once the times permitted recruitment

Elle décrit également son évolution de carrière dans ce milieu :
>In 1960, I applied to the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique for a full time research position. My proposal to study the development of cooperative/competitive social interchanges, was based on experimental methods developed by game theorists. The circumstances were quite favorable. I tend to think that I was “I was at the right place at the right moment” borrowing this explanation to the justification given by the first women to access to high leadership positions and become cabinet ministers (Apfelbaum, 1993a) . Given the increase in hiring possibilities, Robert Pagès was developing his team in the Laboratoire de Psychologie Sociale, giving it an orientation which encouraged experimental projects and mathematical formalisation at the same time as he was opening it up to the widest possible range of social psychological topics. In the midst of these developments, I was assigned -- or may be I chose -- the area of conflicts, bargaining and negotiation.
